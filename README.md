# PowerShellHue

Is a Powershell/ MySQL based script that engages a set of Hue lights. It behaves according a database table holding the sun set times. And will respond to the presence of devices on WiFi.
The suntimes are read from a database table. And the devices are two smartphone, with static IP's. If the devices are not online, it will start a infinite loop, and will turn off the lights.
This script is ran from a Windows 10 based HTPC which is not online 24/7.   

Installation / Setting up 

Install your preferred WAMP stack, I choose AppServ. 

1. Unzip the files to your local drive.

2. Populate the database with the right tables, run docs/powershellhue.sql against your MySQL db.

3. Setup a scheduled task (trigger 'On system startup') for starting the powershell scripts. You can use docs/StartPhilpsHue_v2.xml as an example. Mind the absolute path of your files.

4. Setup the following parameters in the variables file.

	- $user, $password, $database = details MySQL in your local WAMP stack.
	- $bridgeIP use this URL to retrieve Bridge IP adres : https://www.meethue.com/api/nupnp

	$loopwaitcounterSec		= The wait time between switching colors in seconds.
	$colortransitiontime	= The duration of the transition from the lightâ€™s current state to the new state. This is given as a multiple of 100ms and defaults to 4 (400ms). For example, setting transistiontime:10 will make the transition last 1 second.
